    """This function elaborates how the computer is going to play, i.e., the computer's strategy of winning this game. There are some main rules that are explained here. Meanwhile, in some of these main rules,
        there are several additional rules that could increase the possibility for the computer to win the game. These additional rules are explained behind that specific part of codes. The first main rule is that
        the computer each time chooses a brick from the discard pile and replaces a brick by default unless it encounters some conditions. There are some conditions in which the computer instead chooses a brick from main pile
        and replaces a brick or directly puts the brick from the main pile into the discard pile(skips the turn). Those conditions are elaborated later. The second main rule is that when choosing a brick
        (either from the discard pile or the main pile), we compare this chosen brick to each one of the bricks in the given tower in order. If the chosen brick is bigger than the brick from the given tower,
        we skip this given brick and move on to compare with the next brick in the given tower. If the chosen brick is smaller than the brick from the given tower, we keep comparing the chosen brick to the next brick
        in the given tower, if the chosen brick is also smaller than the next one, we substitute the first one with our chosen brick. If the chosen brick is bigger than the next one(under the condition that the chosen brick is smaller
        than the first one), then we choose not to replace the first one with our chosen brick and we move on to the next brick and iterate the process above instead. The third main rule is that we categorize the discard pile into two sets. 
        One set is between 1 and 30(30 inclusive), the other is between 31 and 60(31 inclusive). If any brick from the former five bricks of the given tower is bigger than 30, then we replace this brick with the given brick
        from the first set of the discard pile. If any brick from the latter five bricks of the given tower is smaller than 20, then we replace this brick with the given brick from the second set of the discard pile. The fourth main rule is that
        the second main rule applies to both main pile and the discard pile. There are some important additional rules branching under these main rules that are explained further not here but behind that specific part of the codes below."""
